## Agenda 

### Hiatus?

There has been very little activity of late. As convener I'd like to propose a hiatus until we can usefully contribute to CLAW.

- There was agreement that there are not enough implementation resources available to contribute to UIIG ideas.
- Proposal to take a hiatus from active meetings but be available if any issue arises (i.e. send us the bat-signal, as with any UG).



Next Meeting
- TBD
